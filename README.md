### How does this work?

When you send `s/i/n` in Discord, it modifies your most recent message using the [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) format. Specifically, it replaces the first occurrence of the second parameter (`i`) in the message with the third parameter (`n`).

|     Before     |     After      |
| :------------: | :------------: |
| t**i**ktok.com | t**n**ktok.com |

> [!TIP]
> If you run a Discord server, I highly recommend adding [FixTweetBot](https://github.com/Kyrela/FixTweetBot) to your server. It automatically modifies links to use embed fixers like fxTikTok, and is highly customizable.

### Using Direct Embeds

Don't want all that statistic clutter on your embed and only want the video or image? Simply change your URL to `d.tnktok.com`

|         Before         |        After         |
| :--------------------: | :------------------: |
| **www**.t**i**ktok.com | **d**.t**n**ktok.com |

> Alternatively, you can also set `isDirect` to true thru the URL query by adding `?isDirect=true` at the end of your URL

### "I don't see the video's caption!"

By default, we put the description into the `og:description` tag, but Discord removes that from the embed if there's a video inside the embed. We decided not to add it to the top like what [tfxktok.com](https://tfxktok.com) does to prevent the embed from getting too cluttered with hashtags.

However, we want to give users the option to add it in case it brings additional context to the video. You can change your URL to `a.tnktok.com` to add the description to the top.

|         Before         |        After         |
| :--------------------: | :------------------: |
| **www**.t**i**ktok.com | **a**.t**n**ktok.com |

> Alternatively, you can also set `addDesc` to true thru the URL query by adding `?addDesc=true` at the end of your URL

### Changing to High Quality

TikTok supports H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) which offers significantly better quality at the same file size compared to H.264, at the cost of compatibility. By default, we use H.264 quality since [many users report issues with embeds breaking with H.265](https://github.com/okdargy/fxTikTok/issues/14), but support enabling H.265.

To enable high quality H.265 playback, add `?hq=true` or use `hq.tnktok.com`:
| Before | After |
| :--------------------: | :------------------: |
| **www**.t**i**ktok.com | **hq**.t**n**ktok.com |

### Combining Modes

You can combine different modes by using specific hostnames or URL query parameters. For example, if you want to enable H.265 and also see the caption, you can use `hq.a.tnktok.com` or add `?hq=true&addDesc=true` to the URL.

> You cannot use Direct Mode and Caption Mode simultaneously since they contradict themselves.

### Why use tnktok.com?

We check all the boxes for being one of the best TikTok embedding services with many features that others don't have. Here's a table comparing our service, tnktok.com, with the other TikTok embedding services as well as TikTok's default embeds.

## 💻 Selfhosting

By default, when setting up a new fxTikTok instance, the default offload server is `offload.tnktok.com`.
To setup your own, just compile and run [`offload.ts`](/src/offload.ts) which will start on port **8787**.

```bash
# Install all necessary dependencies
pnpm install
# Start your server
bun run src/offload.ts
```

> I recommend configuring this to your own domain alongside a reverse proxy like [nginx](https://nginx.org) and on top of Cloudflare with protection on.

Next, deploy your Worker with the button below and follow the instructions.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/okdargy/fxtiktok)

Once done, go to "Settings" and change your offload server under "Variables and Secrets":

## 📈 Observability

fxTikTok exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` only when `METRICS_ENABLED=true` is set in the environment. Route traffic is grouped by route pattern, not raw URLs, so `/@user/video/123` and `/@other/video/456` both roll up under the same route label.

The API uses the [prom-client](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client) npm package to keep in-process counters and latency histograms with low overhead and no per-request storage. Historical reporting comes from Prometheus retention, which is what lets Grafana show hourly, daily, and longer time ranges even though application counters reset on restart.

Example Prometheus scrape config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fxtiktok
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - your-api-domain.example.com
```

Useful exported metrics:

- `fxtiktok_requests_total{route,method,status_class}`
- `fxtiktok_request_duration_seconds_bucket{route,method,le}`
- `fxtiktok_request_duration_seconds_sum{route,method}`
- `fxtiktok_request_duration_seconds_count{route,method}`
- `fxtiktok_unhandled_exceptions_total{route,method,exception_type}`
